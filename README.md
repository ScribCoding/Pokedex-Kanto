# kanto_pokedex
Description: A kanto pokedex in website form.
Wanted to create this project with the purpose of learning more css with many javascript functions.


Things to work from doing this project:
1. Plan out project first thoroughly
2. Organize Javascript and CSS properly and thoughtfully
3. Work on css positioning more for consistency. Also make project able to be viewed on other platforms
